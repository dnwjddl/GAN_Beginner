andproduced a litter of cubs . one day the fox went out foraging for food , and the eagle , who also wanted food for her young , flew down into thethicket , caught up the fox\\'s cubs , and carried them up into the treefor a meal for herself and her family . when the fox came back , andfound out what had happened , she was not so much sorry for the loss ofher cubs as furious because she couldn\\'t get at the eagle and pay herout for her treachery . so she sat down not far off and cursed her . butit wasn\\'t long before she had her revenge . some villagers happened tobe sacrificing a goat on a neighbouring altar , and the eagle flew downand carried off a piece of burning flesh to her nest . there was astrong wind blowing , and the nest caught fire , with the result thather
